## Summary
In summary, this analysis shows based on the data and queries done that the Surf and Shake shop would be in a good location at Oahu. There are only small differences between the month of June and December. In order to get a better understand of the location, first it would be a good idea to find the most popular months that tourists are in Oahu. Then gather the weather data for those months. Another query that I would run next would be to find out other weather data besides temperature, for example precipitation, wind and/or cloudiness.
