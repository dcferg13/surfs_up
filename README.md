## Summary
In summary, this analysis shows based on the data and queries done that the Surf and Shake shop would be in a good location at Oahu. There are only small differences between the month of June and December. Another query that I would run for the months of June and December would be to find out other weather data besides temperature, for example precipitation, wind and/or cloudiness. A second query that I would want to run would be to gather the same data from 3 stations with the most observations. However, if we wanted to get more data about this location in Oahu, perhaps we could find the most popular months that tourists are in Oahu. Then gather the weather data for those months.
